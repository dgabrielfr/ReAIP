eAIP is a Python (v3) script to download all the eAIP charts in PDF form.
For the current version, 0.2a, it is limited to the charts provided by the SIA (Service d'information a√©ronautique) in its eAIP section, so IFR charts of the French airports.
Planned features include:
  * Backup of old AIRAC and folder management (backup done)
  * GUI for more intuitive and better user experience (WIP)
